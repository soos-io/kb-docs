Set up an GitHub Action Workflow to scan SARIF 2.1 files with SOOS SAST.

## Prerequisites

- You need to have a [SOOS account](https://app.soos.io/register) with SAST scanning enabled.
- Node 20 LTS or higher enabled in the workflow.
- You need to have previously generated Sarif 2.1 json in file(s) that end with the `.sarif.json` extension.

## Steps

### **Repository Setup**
* Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository on GitHub if it does not already exist.
* In the `.github/workflows` directory, create a file named `main.yml`. For more information on creating new files, see [Creating new files in GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/creating-new-files).
* Paste the script from the [GitHub Action SAST Integration page on SOOS](https://app.soos.io/integrate/sast?id=github-actions).

### **Build Setup**

**Set Up Environment Variables**

Under your Repository's Settings tab, select "Secrets" > "Actions" and add two new secrets containing the SOOS Client Id and API Key, which you can find in the SOOS App under [Integrate](https://app.soos.io/integrate).

The secret names should be `SOOS_CLIENT_ID` and `SOOS_API_KEY`.

### **Build Config**
Modify the `.github/workflows/main.yml` file, replacing the `project_name` variable value with one relevant to your project.

## Run It
To run the SOOS CLI against your repositoryâ€™s code, execute a build or commit a change. The build will use the environment variables created for the API Key and Client ID.

### **Setup**

```yaml
name: Example workflow using SOOS
# Events required to engage workflow (edit this list as needed)
on: [push]

jobs:
  soos_sast_analysis_example:
    name: SOOS SAST Analysis Example
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Run SOOS SAST Analysis
        uses: soos-io/soos-sast-github-action@v1 # GET Latest Version from https://github.com/marketplace/actions/soos-sast
        with:
          client_id: ${{ secrets.SOOS_CLIENT_ID }}
          api_key: ${{ secrets.SOOS_API_KEY }}
          project_name: "My Project Name"
```
