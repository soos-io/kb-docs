Set up an Azure DevOps pipeline project and scan an endpoint with SOOS DAST.

## Prerequisites

- You need to have a [SOOS account](https://app.soos.io/register) with DAST scanning enabled.
- You need to have an Azure DevOps Project with a Pipeline.
- Add the [**SOOS Security Analysis**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SOOS.SOOS-Security-Analysis) task to your organization in Azure DevOps.
- The pipeline job must run the task on a Linux build agent.

## Steps

### **Use a Linux Build Agent**

Your pipeline stage must use a Linux build agent:
```
  pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
```

### **Installing the task**

The SOOS task will be found under the shared extension listing in your organization settings. Click the option to install the task. The installation has been completed successfully when it is visible under the Installed listing.

### **Setup variables**

Once installed search for the SOOS under tasks and proceed with the configuration.

- Select Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) for the Scan Type parameter
- - Configure the SOOS variables, either directly in the yaml section or in the Task variables section. Use the API Key and Client ID values you collected from the SOOS App.

Make sure to also set the Display Name, Project Name (which groups scans together), Target Uri and Scan mode parameters.

### **Setting up inside your pipeline.yml**

Once we have defined these variables globally you can set up the task to be used inside your pipeline.yml following this example script.

```
# NOTE: requires a Linux build agent

- task: SOOS-Security-Analysis@0
  displayName: SOOS DAST Scan
  continueOnError: true
  inputs:
    clientId: <client_id>
    apiKey: <api_key>
    scanType: 'DAST'
    targetUri: <target_url>
    projectName: "<project_name>"
```

### **Run It**

To run the SOOS Azure DevOps task against your repositoryâ€™s code, just execute a build or commit a change. The build will use the environment variables that you created for the API Key and Client ID.
