- Select Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) for the Scan Type parameter
- Configure the SOOS variables, either directly in the yaml section or in the Task variables section.  Use the API Key and Client ID values you collected from the SOOS App.

Make sure to also set the Display Name, Project Name (which groups scans together), Target Uri and Scan mode parameters.

### **Setting up inside your pipeline.yml**

Once we have defined these variables globally you can set up the task to be used inside your pipeline.yml following this example script.

```
- task: SOOS-Security-Analysis@0
  inputs:
    apiKey: {SOOS_API_KEY}
    clientId: {SOOS_CLIENT_ID}
    scanType: 'DAST'
    project: {YOUR_PROJECT_NAME_HERE}
    targetUri: 'https://example.com'
    scanMode: 'baseline'
```

### **Run It**

To run the SOOS Azure DevOps task against your repositoryâ€™s code, just execute a build or commit a change. The build will use the environment variables that you created for the API Key and Client ID.
