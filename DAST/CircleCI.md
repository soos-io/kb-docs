Set up a CircleCI pipeline project and scan an endpoint with SOOS DAST via the SOOS CircleCI DAST Orb.

## Prerequisites

- You need to have a [SOOS account](https://app.soos.io/register) with DAST scanning enabled.

## Steps

### **Repo Setup**
- Create a directory called .circleci in the root directory of your local GitHub or Bitbucket code repository.
- Create a config.yml file inside the .circleci directory with the following lines (if you are using CircleCI server v2.x, use version: 2.0 configuration):

```
    version: 2.1
    orbs:
        soos: soos-io/dast@x.y.z # Check latest version on https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/soos-io/dast

    workflows:
        main:
            jobs:

                # NOTE: YOUR OTHER JOBS GO HERE

                - soos/dast-analysis:
                    client_id: "<<SOOS Client Id env var name IF YOURS IS SOOS_CLIENT_ID there's no need to pass anything>>"
                    api_key: "<<SOOS API Key en var name IF YOURS IS SOOS_API_KEY there's no need to pass anything>>"
                    project_name: "<<Project Name>>"
                    target_url: "<<Your Target URL To Scan>>"

                # NOTE: YOUR OTHER JOBS GO HERE
```


- Commit and push the changes.
