Set up an Azure DevOps pipeline to scan CycloneDX or SPDX SBOMs with SOOS SBOM.

## Prerequisites
- You need to have a [SOOS account](https://app.soos.io/register).
- You need to have an Azure DevOps Project with a Pipeline.
- You need to have a repository, connected to that pipeline, with a [supported](https://kb.soos.io/help/sbom-upload) SBOM file.
- Add the [**SOOS Security Analysis**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SOOS.SOOS-Security-Analysis) task to your organization in Azure DevOps.
- If you are running a self-hosted agent make sure to have Node 18.12.0 or higher - https://nodejs.org/en/download on the agent. Also you can look to use [Use Node Task](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/use-node-v1?view=azure-pipelines)

## Steps
- After successfully installing the task, copy the contents of the [`azuredevops_sbom.yml`](https://gist.github.com/soostech/983b3756ea3f6e3631d89c97604bd969) file from the [Azure DevOps Integrations page in the SOOS app](https://app.soos.io/integrate/SBOM?id=azure-devops) into your `azure-pipelines.yml` file.
- Set the corresponding task parameters or use environment variables with the `Client ID` and `API Key` values found on the same [Azure DevOps Integrations page](https://app.soos.io/integrate/SBOM?id=azure-devops).

## Optional Setup
Enable the following parameter as desired:
- `continueOnError`: Set to prevent a failed build during the maintenance window (Azure Task Parameter).

## Task Results
- In your pipeline, the task will Succeed, Succeed with Issues, or Fail.
- The task will fail during a maintenance window unless `continueOnError` is set to true.
- If your Scan/Build settings in the [SOOS app](https://app.soos.io/settings/global) are configured to fail the build upon identifying a vulnerability or policy violation, the task will wait for the scan to complete and set the result accordingly.
  - Note: Scan/Build settings can be configured globally or overridden at the project level. Configure these settings [here](https://app.soos.io/settings/global).
- Each scan outputs a console link to view the scan results.
  - Note: If a scan is incomplete when viewing the results, the information in the app will not be up-to-date.

## Run It
To run the SOOS Azure DevOps task against your repositoryâ€™s code, simply execute a build or commit a change.
