In this article we will make the necessary modifications to a GitHub Workflow using the SOOS CI Analysis GitHub Action to scan a GitHub repository with SOOS.

## Prerequisites

- You need to have a [SOOS account.](https://app.soos.io/register)
- You need to have a GitHub Repo.

## Steps

### **Repo Setup**
* Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository on GitHub if this directory does not already exist.
* In the `.github/workflows` directory, create a file named main.yml.
For more information, see "Creating new files" in GitHub Docs.
* Paste the script given in the [GitHub Action SCA Integration page on SOOS](https://app.soos.io/integrate/sca?id=github-actions).


### **Build Setup**

Setup Environment Variables

Under your Repository's Settings tab, select "Secrets" > "Actions" and add two new secrets which contain the SOOS Client Id and API Key which you can find in the SOOS App under [Integrate](https://app.soos.io/integrate)

The secret names should be "SOOS_CLIENT_ID" and "SOOS_API_KEY"

### **Build Config**
Modify the `.github/workflows/main.yml` file, replacing the provided project_name variable value with one that is relevant to your project.

## Run It
To run the SOOS CLI against your repositoryâ€™s code, just execute a build or commit a change. The build will use the environment variables that you created for the API Key and Client ID.

 
## **Configure GitHub Code Scan Output**

If you are using GitHub Enterprise or your repository is public, you can configure the SOOS Action to display any issues in GitHub Code Scanning Alerts. There are a few additional steps to get this configured.

### **Setup**

   - Create a new GitHub Personal Access Token which has a "repo" > "security_events" scope
   - Copy the PAT value and add it to a new Action Secret for your repository with a name of "SOOS_GPAT"
   - Adjust your Action code to pass the "sarif" and "gpat" parameters

```

        api_key: ${{ secrets.SOOS_API_KEY }}
```
