In this article we will make the necessary modifications to a simple TravisCI project to scan a GitHub or Bitbucket repository with the SOOS SCA PRODUCT.

## Prerequisites

- You need to have a [SOOS account.](https://app.soos.io/register)
- You need to have a Travis repo.
- Have downloaded the latest release of the `soos.py`,`requirements.txt` and `VERSION.txt` from [here](https://github.com/soos-io/soos-ci-analysis-python/releases/)

## Steps

### **Repo Setup**
* Create a new folder in your repository: `<repo_root>/soos/workspace/`
* Place the `requirements.txt`, `soos.py` and `VERSION.txt` files in the `<repo_root>/soos/workspace` folder.
* Commit these 2 new files and the new folder path.

### **Configure Travis CI**
**Setup Environment Variables**

* Within TravisCI, navigate to Settings.
* Create the SOOS_API_KEY and SOOS_CLIENT_ID environment variables in the Environment Variables section
* Copy & paste the API key and Client ID values from the [Travis CI Integration page of the SOOS App](https://app.soos.io/integrate/sca?id=travis-ci).  These will serve as environment variables to be used by the SOOS CLI.
* Add the SOOS script from the [Travis CI Integration page of the SOOS App](https://app.soos.io/integrate/sca?id=travis-ci) to your repository's /.travis.yml file.

## Run It
To run the SOOS CLI against your repositoryâ€™s code, just execute a build or commit a change. The build will use the environment variables that you created for the API Key and Client ID.
